nestJS Starter.

**NestJs** reduces a lot of the time wasted tinkering on directories structure, setting up tests, routes, database connections and so on, everything is solved for the average use case.

**The Nest CLI** is a command-line interface tool that helps you to initialize, develop, and maintain your Nest applications. It assists in multiple ways, including scaffolding the project, serving it in development mode, and building and bundling the application for production distribution. It embodies best-practice architectural patterns to encourage well-structured apps.
